    This hike is so awesome, I did it three times this summer. Which
    adds up to six times in my life. I think that says a lot.

You don't need a map -- just follow the crowd. Take the John Muir Trail down from
Nevada to save your knees and get a picturesque view of
Liberty Cap and Nevada Fall!

I made three camping trips out to Yosemite this summer.
And every single time I went, I hiked this trail. So this'll
just be a combined report.

# Trip Report

The record snowfall in the Sierras this year meant that
the waterfalls were epicly swollen and raging.
This photo was taken from the
Vernal Fall footbridge. Even though I'd already been here 3 times before my June 2017 trip,
I'd never seen the Merced River like this.

In June, we went up pretty early in the morning at around 8:30am, and there I
witnessed some of the most beautiful light I'd ever seen. The sun streaming
through the mist created some awesome "God rays".

The photos aren't that sharp, since my lens was completely covered in water. Honestly,
my camera probably sustained some water damage since it was getting _SOAKED_.

As you descend from Nevada Fall via the John Muir Trail, you're rewarded
with an amazing view of Libery Cap and Nevada Fall.

And if you can stay after sunset at the top of Nevada Fall, you gotta!
It's spectacular. Literally no one else does it, since you have to hike the 4 mile
descent to the valley floor in the dark. But it's so worth it&hellip; I'll
let this picture speak for itself.
