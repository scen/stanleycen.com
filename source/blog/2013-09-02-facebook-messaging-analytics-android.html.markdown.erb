title: Facebook messaging analytics for Android

For the past five days I've been working on an open source Android application for
analyzing your Facebook messaging data.

This is a mobile version of the web app [here](http://github.com/scen/fbstats).

I tried to follow the Android UI guidelines
as closely as possible and even emulated Google's new card interface! Here's a couple of screenshots:

<%=

    :caption => 'More trends over time',
    :width => 300,
)
%>
<%=

### Technical details

The "Cards UI" is essentially a custom `ListView` with a large transparent separator.
The border is rendered through a ninepatch generated from a screenshot. Since I thought the current
free android graphing libraries are lacking in the visuals department, I created my own
graph library based off of `HoloGraphLibrary`, which currently supports bar, pie, and line charts.

Messages are downloaded in a foreground service and committed into a SQLite database, which ends up being a
couple of megabytes. In fact, much of the downloaded data is not yet utilized by the application,
including location data and attachments. When I have time in the future,  I'll be sure to add in the features
I'm missing from the HTML/Javascript version.

### Ending notes

In these couple of days I've learned so much more about android programming. As a result, my code
from the beginning of the project is much less than optimal since I didn't know much about the Android API.
However, the source code will still be available! After I prepare and finalize it, you'll find it [here](http://github.com/scen/)!
