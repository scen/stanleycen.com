I redesigned this site again.

It essentially was an online version of my resume --
there wasn't much content except a few technical posts I'd written in high school.

But my priorities have changed a bit
since the time I last updated this site almost two years ago. I've rekindled my interest in photography. I'm minoring in music now.
And living in California the past two summers with a car meant that I was able to
more fully
explore and fall in love with the mountain splendor, the rugged beauty of the outdoors.
And with 10+ backpacking and camping trips in the past year alone,
I wanted a way to record/share my experiences and photography online.
The hope is that others will find the trip reports useful too!

So that's that. I hope to continue blogging about my adventures, and hope that
you find it useful or get inspired to hit the trail!
