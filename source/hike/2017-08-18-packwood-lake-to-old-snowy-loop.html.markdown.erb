blurb: >
    An extraordinary trip that included summiting the highest point along the
    PCT in Washington, grand alpine vistas, two ridge walks, lush forests, two high camps.
    Three passing NOBO PCT thru-hikers mentioned that this was the most epic and beautiful
    section they've experienced so far. I think that says a lot.
