The station opens at 8am, and although we arrived at 7:15am, there were already 4-5 groups ahead of us! In the end, everything worked out. We managed to snatch the last 2 permits for Lake Aloha (Zone 33).</p> <p>Parking near the trailhead was was a nightmare &ndash; everything was full. We ended up parking alongside the road approximately .5 miles away from the actual trailhead.</p> <p>The trail was easy to find, and there weren&rsquo;t too many snowbanks left on the trail itself. The ones that were left didn&rsquo;t require any special equipment to across. Just follow signs for PCT and Lake Aloha. There&rsquo;s so many people on the trail that you can&rsquo;t lose your away.</p> <p>We spent some time looking for a good place to set up camp. We wanted something that was isolated, flat, far enough from water (leave no trace!), and had a good view of the Crystal Range towering over the lake.</p> <p>I noticed that a lot of people set up camp near the south to south-east shore of the lake. This part is pretty forested, and the views aren&rsquo;t as good. If you hike 0.5 to 1 mile along the eastern shore you&rsquo;ll find tons of good spots.</p> <div style="width: 100%" class=photo-wrap> <div class="center hover expand photo" style="max-width: 100%;"> <a class="lightbox popout-lightbox" href="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/campsite.jpg" title="Our campsite" target=_blank> <img src="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/campsite.jpg" alt="Our campsite" style="max-width: 100%;"/> </a> </div> <div class=caption> <span>Our campsite</span> </div> </div> <p>Mosquitos were a lot better than expected! There were definitely swarms with thousands of mosquitos, but most of them didn&rsquo;t bite. The breeze next to the lake definitely helps. I used a headnet, but it wasn&rsquo;t necessary, except maybe after sunset.</p> <p>The sunset was amazing. Every single time, without fail, I&rsquo;m taken aback by the beauty of an alpine sunset. It&rsquo;s no wonder why John Muir called the Sierra Nevada the &ldquo;Range of Light&rdquo;.</p> <div style="width: 100%" class=photo-wrap> <div class="center hover expand photo" style="max-width: 100%;"> <a class="lightbox popout-lightbox" href="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/sunset.jpg" title="Sunset over the Crystal Range" target=_blank> <img src="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/sunset.jpg" alt="Sunset over the Crystal Range" style="max-width: 100%;"/> </a> </div> <div class=caption> <span>Sunset over the Crystal Range</span> </div> </div> <div style="width: 100%" class=photo-wrap> <div class="center hover expand photo" style="max-width: 100%;"> <a class="lightbox popout-lightbox" href="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/sunset_behind.jpg" title="Last light on the peak behind our camp" target=_blank> <img src="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/sunset_behind.jpg" alt="Last light on the peak behind our camp" style="max-width: 100%;"/> </a> </div> <div class=caption> <span>Last light on the peak behind our camp</span> </div> </div> <p>We went to bed around 10pm, and I set my alarm for 3am so I could attempt to photograph the Milky Way over the Crystal Range.</p> <h3>Day 2</h3> <p>I slept without a rain fly, so when I opened my eyes at 3am I was blown away. The stars shined so so bright, and I could see the Milky Way (<strong>OUR OWN GALAXY!!!!</strong>) with my own naked eyes! It was truly unforgettable. I spent almost 2 hours staring and taking photos. Conditions were perfect &ndash; here wasn&rsquo;t any wind at 3am, and the water was perfectly still. I&rsquo;m super proud of this photo.</p> <div style="width: 100%" class=photo-wrap> <div class="center hover expand photo" style="max-width: 100%;"> <a class="lightbox popout-lightbox" href="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/milkyway.jpg" title="Milky Way over Lake Aloha" target=_blank> <img src="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/milkyway.jpg" alt="Milky Way over Lake Aloha" style="max-width: 100%;"/> </a> </div> <div class=caption> <span>Milky Way over Lake Aloha</span> </div> </div> <p>I went to sleep around 5am and set an alarm for 5:30am to watch the sunrise. Super worth! I actually left my tripod there overnight so I managed to capture the same scene at sunrise.</p> <div style="width: 100%" class=photo-wrap> <div class="center hover expand photo" style="max-width: 100%;"> <a class="lightbox popout-lightbox" href="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/header.jpg" title="Sunrise over Lake Aloha" target=_blank> <img src="/hike/2017/lake-aloha/header.jpg" alt="Sunrise over Lake Aloha" style="max-width: 100%;"/> </a> </div> <div class=caption> <span>Sunrise over Lake Aloha</span> </div> </div> <p>We had breakfast shortly afterwards, broke camp, and quickly hiked back to the trailhead before temperatures started climbing.</p> <p>This was probably my last backpacking trip into the Sierras for the season, since I&rsquo;m finishing up my internship and going back home soon. I wish I&rsquo;d gone on more trips this summer! It&rsquo;s such a shame the season started so late due to insane snowfall.
