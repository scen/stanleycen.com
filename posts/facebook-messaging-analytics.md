# Facebook Messaging Analytics

A couple of days ago I randomly had to urge to look at my activity over Facebook messaging, a service I use quite a bit. Facebook doesn't provide an interface to easily view information about my chats, nor do they provide a method to easily and quickly download your chat data (except the zip archive, but that takes hours to generate and is usually out of date once it's downloaded).
