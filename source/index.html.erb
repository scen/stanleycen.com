    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
    I'm a senior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working towards a major in Computer Science
    with a minor in Music (concentrating in theory &amp; composition).
    Unless something dramatically changes, I'm gonna be a software engineer.
    In the past, I've interned at Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and Jane Street.

    <b>Music keeps me sane&hellip;</b> I've played the piano for most of my life,
    and I love to improvise. Currently trying to learn to learn jazz piano.
    Sometimes, I <a href="#">arrange</a> or <a href="#">compose</a> music.
    Other times, I noodle around on my guitar or ukelele. I wish I could sing well.
    </p>

    <p class="no-margin-bottom">
    <b>&hellip;but what I love most is exploring the outdoors.</b>
    I'm addicted. There's nothing more satisfying and liberating than
    being out in the wilderness, relying on nothing but friends &amp; the contents of my backpack.
    I recently started a <a href="/hikes">hiking journal</a>. It's mostly
    to help me keep track of all my experiences &amp; photos, but I hope you guys find it useful too! If not, I hope it at least inspires you to go outside and explore!

    <b>I also love to take pictures&hellip;</b>
    mostly in an attempt to capture the indescribable beauty found on our planet.
    It all started when I took a photography class my senior year of high school.
    I love the idea of using photos to freeze time, to preserve memories, forever.
    Photography (especially landscape) really forces you to slow down and
    soak in your surroundings &mdash; it goes hand-in-hand with exploring the outdoors!

    I shoot on a Sony A6000 mirrorless with a Sony 35mm f/1.8 prime, (vintage) Minolta 50mm f/1.4 prime, and a Rokinon 12mm f/2.0 prime.
    The Rokinon is awesome &mdash; I've been trying
    to improve my astrophotography, and its focal length and wide
    aperture make it so much easier!

    All the photos on this website were taken by me. Hope you enjoy!
