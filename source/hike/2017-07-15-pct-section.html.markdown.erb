We essentially stayed on the PCT the entire way. Here's the route we took:

# Trip Report

We departed for the El Dorado Ranger Station from San Francisco at 5:00am on Saturday
in order to get the last minute first-come, first-served overnight permits.
The station opens at 8am, and although we arrived at 7:15am,
there were already 4-5 groups ahead of us!
In the end, everything worked out. We managed to snatch the last 2
permits for Lake Aloha (Zone 33).

Parking near the trailhead was was a nightmare -- everything was full. We ended up parking alongside the road
approximately .5 miles away from the actual trailhead.

The actual trail was pretty uneventful.
