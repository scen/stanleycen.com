P.S. there's an Android version [here](/blog/facebook-messaging-analytics-android)!

The original blog post for this web application is [here](/blog/facebook-messaging-analytics).

I made a couple of small updates to my Facebook Messaging Analytics project.
It now uses the the Google Maps Geocoding API to determine where each message
was sent from if the position data exists. We can also overlay the
latitude/longitude coordinates onto a Google Map canvas. Two examples
are shown below:

<div class="photo" noresize cloudinary src="map2_isqjcf.png">Example 2</div>

I also added a global date selector to let the user selectively
analyze specific time spans. More to come...
