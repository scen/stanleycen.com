  A library that bootstraps and accelerates the reverse engineering process. Provides a C++ API to hook functions,
  set breakpoints, signature scan, draw APIs and more. It also exposes an equivalent Lua API for on-the-fly development.

  A library that bootstraps and accelerates the reverse engineering process. Provides a C++ API to hook functions,
  set breakpoints, signature scan, draw APIs and more. It also exposes an equivalent Lua API for on-the-fly development. Built in live-reloading
  decreases prototyping time further by removing the need to relaunch the application.

  ### Notable Features
  
  * Instantly draw into DirectX 9 - 11, OpenGL, and Source Engine scenes

  * JMP Detours, Midfunction Hooks, Virtual Method Table hooks, and HWBP hooks

  * Flexible memory management API

  * Call any C++/ASM function with any of the following calling conventions
      * `__stdcall`
      * `__thiscall`
      * `__fastcall`
      * `__cdecl`
  * Easy to use event handling system

  * All C++ functionality is available to Lua via a convenient wrapper

  * Lua wrapper has access to registers during a trampoline call

  * Advanced LoadLibrary emulation to hide module from scanners
